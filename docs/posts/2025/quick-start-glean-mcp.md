# Introduction

Glean just released a beta of their remote MCP server. This allows any AI assistant app tht supports MCP, like Claude/Claude Code, Cursor, Goose, etc; to use Glean to seamlessly search across all of the data you have access to in your company; regardless of the app it's located in - all without having to manually integrate with each (over MCP or otherw
ise)!








This article will cover:
* How to get started with accessing Glean via some common apps. If you're not overly technical, then don't worry - you're in the right place!

This article won't cover:
* How to setup Glean's remote MCP server in your Glean environment as a Glean admin.
  * I'll aim to cover this in a future article, as well as how to setup a local version of Glean's MCP server as a technical playground.

!!! info
    At the time of writing this article, Glean's Remote MCP server is currently in closed beta.


## Claude Desktop (Recommended)

This is how I would recommend most people try out Glean via MCP. It is the simplest to setup and is universal in its <???>

1. Download Claude Desktop here: [https://claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Install and open the app.
3. Log into your Claude account (or create one if don't have one)
	!!! tip
		You don't need a paid Claude account to integrate with Glean via MCP. A free account will work fine (though a paid account will give you access to Claude Opus 4)

!!! tip
    Hello there!
